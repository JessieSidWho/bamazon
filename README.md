<br><br>
Bamazon is a storefront on the CLI. It displays the products that are in stock and how much are in stock. 
<br><br>
The program will first ask you to choose the product you are interested in buying.<br><br>
Then the program will ask you how much. If you ask for more than what's in stock, it will not let you purchase. If there is enough in stock, then the program will complete the purchase. The program will also ask you if you still have shopping to do after your purchase and if there wasn't enough of the product you initially had asked for. <br><br>

After the products are purchased. The MYSQL database is automatically updated. <br><br>

Enjoy!
